# Optimal Page Replacement

This case study is a website that enables the user to compute the number of page faults of a randomly generated page reference string using the **optimal page-replacement algorithm**. The aforementioned algorithm mainly decides the page frame to be changed by determining the farthest page from all the frames. An absent page in the future pages has the highest priority. 

In contrast to First In First Out (FIFO) and Least Recently Used (LRU), it is the most efficient page-replacing algorithm. Because of its speed, I selected this algorithm instead of the aforementioned two others. However, Optimal Page-Replacing Algorithm is not used in reality because the computer has no knowledge or means of determining the pages in the future.
